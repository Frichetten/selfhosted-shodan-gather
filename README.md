# selfhosted-shodan-gather
Side project to catalog various selfhosted services on the internet using Shodan; Gather metrics on usage over time.

The goal was to run this twice a day and create pretty dashboards, unfortunately I just ran into Shodan's API limits. Not so sure this is going to work out.
